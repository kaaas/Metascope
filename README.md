# Metascope

Metascope is a metadata management tool built at Otto Group. Metascope is able to collect technical, operational and business metadata from your Hadoop Datahub and displays the metadata to the user through a web service.

Metascope serves as an extension to [Schedoscope](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope).
